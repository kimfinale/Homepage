	Look to this day! 
</p>
<p>
	For it is life, the very life of life. <br>
	In its brief course <br>
	Lie all the verities and realities of your existence:<br>
	The bliss of growth,<br>
	The glory of action,<br>
	The splendor of achievement,<br>
</p>
<p>
	For yesterday is but a dream <br>
	And tomorrow is just a vision,<br>
	And today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness <br>
	And every tomorrow a vision of hope.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Look well, therefore to this day!<br>
	Such is the salutation to the dawn.<br>
