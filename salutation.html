	<h3>Salutation to the Dawn</h3><br>
	<p>
		Look to this day!<br>
		For it is life, the very life of life.<br>
		In its brief course<br>
		Lie all the verities and realities of your existence:<br>
		The bliss of growth<br>
		The glory of action<br>
		The splendor of beauty<br>
		For yesterday is but a dream<br>
		And tomorrow only a vision<br>
		But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness<br>
		And every tomorrow a vision of hope.<br>
		Look well, therefore to this day!<br>
		Such is the salutation to the dawn.<br> 
	</p>
